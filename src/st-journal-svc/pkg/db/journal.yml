        Shorted EUR/USD following a hawkish statement from the Federal Reserve, indicating potential interest rate hikes. The bearish sentiment was confirmed by a breakdown below key support levels on the 1-hour chart. Managed the trade using a tight stop loss, but was stopped out as the pair reversed sharply following unexpected comments from the European Central Bank.

        Opened a long position in ETH/USD following a bullish breakout on the 4-hour chart, supported by strong buying volume and positive news sentiment around the Ethereum network upgrade. Managed the trade using a wide stop loss to allow for volatility, but price stalled at a key resistance level and began to retrace. Closed the position at breakeven to avoid further drawdown.
